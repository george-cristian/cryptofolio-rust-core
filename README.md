# Crypto Portfolio Core

**Crypto Portfolio Core** is the backend service for the Crypto Portfolio Tracker project. It handles portfolio management logic, API endpoints, and data persistence. This repository serves as the foundation of the project and will evolve as the requirements are finalized.

---

## Key Features (Planned)
- Portfolio management: Add, edit, and view cryptocurrency holdings.
- API for frontend and mobile apps.
- Database integration for persistent storage.
- Designed for scalability and future blockchain integrations.
- Async-first architecture using Rust's ecosystem.

---

## Current Status
This project is in its early stages. Decisions on libraries, frameworks, and database technologies are still under discussion.

---

## Stack and Libraries (Tentative)
The following libraries and frameworks are being considered:
- **Web framework**: `actix-web` or `warp`
- **Database**: `PostgreSQL` with `sqlx` or `diesel` for ORM
- **Async runtime**: `tokio`
- **Testing**: `mockall`, `cargo test`
- **Environment management**: `dotenvy`
- **API Spec**: OpenAPI for documenting endpoints

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/): Recommended version is the latest stable.
- Install a database: PostgreSQL (recommended, version TBD).

### Running Locally
Since the architecture is still under discussion, instructions for running the project locally will be added later.
